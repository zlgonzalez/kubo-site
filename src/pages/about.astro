               <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
                    It is a method of education that was developed by Maria Montessori in 1897. Maria
                    Montessori was the first Italian woman doctor in Italy. She focused on child psychology and pedagogy
                    (Pedagogy refers more broadly to the theory and practice of education, and how this influences the
                    growth of learners. Pedagogy, taken as an academic discipline, is the study of how knowledge and
                    skills are exchanged in an educational context, and it considers the interactions that take place
                    during learning). Using her scientific understanding and observation, Maria Montessori formulated
                    materials that are auto educating. Allowing the child to learn on their own and prepare them to
                    academics.

                      The prepared environment is essential in every Montessori classroom. The areas of Practical
                      Life, Sensorial, Cultural, Math and Language are defined learning space for each child. All
                      Montessori materials are designed to help the brain tap into its scientific and mathematical
                      potential.

                      is always a revelation. Always an “Aha moment” that build their self esteem and creates a
                      better independent interpretation of information.

                   Ms. Mary has been a teacher since 1996, and was inspired into the profession during her
                   college years while doing outreach programs tutoring less fortunate children in South East
                   Asia. She began her teaching career with Jean Piaget Approach with a focus on experiential
                   activities and core curriculum. She felt that she needed more education to be able to learn
                   the child’s specific needs as they discover themselves and the world. She went back to
                   school and began her Masters in Special Education. Eventually, she became a Special
                   Education teacher to children with special needs. She took her Montessori Teacher Training
                   year 2000 (American Montessori Society 2002) in the Bay Area to be able help mainstream
                   special children in a regular classroom set up. She fell in love with the Montessori
                   Philosophy and made a conscious mission to be of service to all children and their families.
                   She continued her studies and completed more ECE and Administration units both from Canada
                   College and Cal State Hayward.
               </p>
               <p>
                   Ms. Mary opened her home to families of Foster City and San Mateo year 2006. She continued
                   serving more families and extended her classroom to 3 locations. We have a Hillsdale
                   location and now Redwood City.
               </p>
               <p>
                   She has two boys of her own who are 19 and 15 years old. Both were Montessori children
                   themselves and attended public Montessori schools. Her husband is the Senior Director of Marqeta’s Data and AI platform.
                   He holds a Masters in Biomedical Informatics from Stanford University. They work together on ensuring that the
                   curriculum stays current and reflects the needs of the rapidly changing industry of Silicon
                   Valley, while preserving the principles of Montessori - independent and self-directed
                   education. As a family, they love making music. Mr. Ron plays the guitar, Ms. Mary sings,
                   Matthew plays violin and Mark plays the piano serving their ministry for Sunday
                   service.

               <p>
                   In June 2019, Ms. Mary received her credential with Association Montessori Internationale
                   (AMI) for Montessori for the Elderly.
