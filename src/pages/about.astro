               <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
                    It is a method of education that was developed by Maria Montessori in 1897. Maria
                    Montessori was the first Italian woman doctor in Italy. She focused on child psychology and pedagogy
                    (Pedagogy refers more broadly to the theory and practice of education, and how this influences the
                    growth of learners. Pedagogy, taken as an academic discipline, is the study of how knowledge and
                    skills are exchanged in an educational context, and it considers the interactions that take place
                    during learning). Using her scientific understanding and observation, Maria Montessori formulated
                    materials that are auto educating. Allowing the child to learn on their own and prepare them to
                    academics.

                      The prepared environment is essential in every Montessori classroom. The areas of Practical
                      Life, Sensorial, Cultural, Math and Language are defined learning space for each child. All
                      Montessori materials are designed to help the brain tap into its scientific and mathematical

           <div class="space-y-6 text-gray-600 text-lg leading-relaxed">
               <p>
                   Ms. Mary’s journey in education began in 1996, sparked by 
                   her time tutoring underserved children in Southeast Asia. 
                   This early experience ignited a lifelong passion for 
                   understanding how children learn, lead, and discover their place in the world. Initially trained in the Jean Piaget approach, Mary quickly realized her calling was to support the "whole child," leading her to pursue a Master’s in Special Education.
               </p>
               <p>
                   In 2000, Mary began her Montessori Teacher Training (AMS, 2002) right here 
                   in the Bay Area. Her goal was to create inclusive environments where 
                   children of all needs could thrive in a mainstream setting. Falling in 
                   love with the philosophy, she made it her mission to serve families through 
                   a blend of rigorous scholarship and deep empathy, eventually completing 
                   advanced ECE and Administration units at Cal State Hayward and 
                   Canada College.
               </p>
               <p>
                   In 2006, Mary opened her first home-based school to the families of 
                   Foster City and San Mateo. Today, that mission has grown into 
                   three vibrant locations across Hillsdale and Redwood City.
               </p>
               <p>
                   Education is a family affair in the Gonzalez household. Mary’s two 
                   sons—now 20 and 16—are proud products of the Montessori system. 
                   Her husband, Ron, brings a unique perspective to the school as a 
                   Distinguished Engineer and VP of AI and Data Engineering at WEX. 
                   Together, they bridge the timeless principles of Montessori—independence 
                   and self-direction—with the technical demands of the rapidly evolving 
                   Silicon Valley landscape.
               </p>
               <p>
                   When they aren’t in the classroom or the lab, the family serves their 
                   community through music. You can find them at Sunday service with 
                   Mr. Ron on guitar, Ms. Mary on vocals, and their sons Matthew and 
                   Mark on violin and piano. In 2019, Mary further extended her 
                   commitment to the Montessori philosophy by earning her AMI credential 
                   for Montessori for the Elderly, ensuring the dignity of self-directed 
                   living is preserved at every stage of life.
